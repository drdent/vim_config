cubrid_fetch_array -- Fetch a result row as an associative array, a numeric
array, or both

  array cubrid_fetch_array(resource result [, int type = CUBRID_BOTH])~

The |cubrid_fetch_array| function is used to get a single row from the query
result and returns an array. The cursor automatically moves to the next row
after getting the result.

{result} {Result} comes from a call to |cubrid_execute|

{type} Array type of the fetched result CUBRID_NUM, CUBRID_ASSOC, CUBRID_BOTH.

Returns an array of strings that corresponds to the fetched row, when process
is successful.

FALSE, when process is unsuccessful.

The type of returned array depends on how type is defined. By using
CUBRID_BOTH (default), you'll get an array with both associative and number
indices, and you can decide which data type to use by setting the {type}
argument. The {type} variable can be set to one of the following values:
