cubrid_get -- Is used to get the attribute

  mixed cubrid_get(resource conn_identifier, string oid [, mixed attr])~

The |cubrid_get| function is used to get the attribute of the instance of the
given {oid}. You can get single attribute by using string data type for the
{attr} argument, or many attributes by using array data type for the {attr}
argument.

{conn_identifier} Connection identifier.

{oid} Oid of the instance that you want to read.

{attr} Name of the attribute that you want to read.

Content of the requested attribute, when process is successful; When {attr} is
set with string data type, the result is returned as a string; when {attr} is
set with array data type (0-based numerical array), then the result is
returned in associative array. When {attr} is omitted, then all attributes are
received in array form.

FALSE when process is unsuccessful or result is NULL (If error occurs to
distinguish empty string from NULL, then it prints the warning message. You
can check the error by using |cubrid_error_code|)
