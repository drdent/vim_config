cubrid_result -- Returns the value of a specific field in a specific row

  string cubrid_result(resource result, int row [, mixed field = 0])~

This function returns the value of a specific field in a specific row from a
result set.

{result} {result} comes from a call to |cubrid_execute|

{row} The row number from the result that is being retrieved. Row numbers
start at 0.

{field} The name or offset of the {field} being retrieved. It can be the
field's offset, the field's name, or the field's table dot field name
(tablename.fieldname). If the column name has been aliased ('select foo as bar
from...'), use the alias instead of the column name. If undefined, the first
field is retrieved.

Value of a specific field, on success (NULL if value if null).

FALSE on failure.
