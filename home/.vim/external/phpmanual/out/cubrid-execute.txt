cubrid_execute -- Is used to execute the given SQL sentence.

  resource cubrid_execute(resource conn_identifier, string SQL [, int option])~

  bool cubrid_execute(resource conn_identifier, string SQL [, int option, resource request_identifier [, int option]])~

The |cubrid_execute| function is used to execute the given SQL sentence. It
executes the query by using {conn_identifier} and SQL, and then returns the
request identifier created. It is used for simple execution of query, where
the parameter binding is not needed. In addition, the |cubrid_execute|
function is used to execute the prepared statement by means of
|cubrid_prepare| and |cubrid_bind|. At this time, you need to specify
arguments of {request_identifier} and {option}.

You can use the {option} argument to tell whether to receive oid of the row
after the execution, and, whether to execute the query in asynchronous mode.
You can use it by setting the CUBRID_INCLUDE_OID and CUBRID_ASYNC using
bitwise or operator. If the both variables are not explicitly given, they are
not selected by default.

If the first argument is {request_identifier} to execute the |cubrid_prepare|
function, you can specify an option, CUBRID_ASYNC only.

{conn_identifier} Connection identifier.

{SQL} SQL to be executed.

{option} Query execution option CUBRID_INCLUDE_OID, CUBRID_ASYNC.

{request_identifier} |cubrid_prepare| identifier.

Request identifier, when process is successful and first param is
conn_identifier; TRUE, when process is successful and first argument is
request_identifier.

FALSE, when process is unsuccessful.
