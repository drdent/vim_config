cubrid_put -- Is used to update an attribute

  int cubrid_put(resource conn_identifier, string oid [, string attr, mixed value])~

The |cubrid_put| function is used to update an attribute of the instance of
the given {oid}.

You can update single attribute by using string data type to set {attr}. In
such case, you can use integer, float-point, or string type data for the
{value} argument. To update multiple number of attributes, you can disregard
the {attr} argument, and set {value} argument with associative array data
type. However, you cannot use the method for attribute of collection type. You
have to use APIs related to collection type (|cubrid_set_add|,
|cubrid_set_drop|, etc) when you want to use |cubrid_put| on collection typed
attribute.

{conn_identifier} Connection identifier.

{oid} Oid of the instance that you want to update.

{attr} Name of the attribute that you want to update.

{value} New value that you want to assign to the attribute.

TRUE, when process is successful.

FALSE, when process is unsuccessful.
