cubrid_unbuffered_query -- Performs a query without fetching the results into
memory

  resource cubrid_unbuffered_query(string query [, resource conn_identifier])~

This function performs a query without waiting for that all query results have
been complete. It will return when the results are being generated.

{query} A SQL query.

{conn_identifier} The CUBRID connection. If the connection identifier is not
specified, the last connection opened by |cubrid_connect| is assumed.

For SELECT, SHOW, DESCRIBE or EXPLAIN statements returns a connection
identifier resource on success.

For other type of SQL statements, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP, etc, returns TRUE on
success.

FALSE on failure.

The benefits of |cubrid_unbuffered_query| come at a cost: you cannot use
|cubrid_num_rows| and |cubrid_data_seek| on a result set returned from
|cubrid_unbuffered_query|.

|cubrid_unbuffered_query| example

<?php >
      $link = cubrid_connect("localhost", 30000, "demodb2", "dba", "");
      if (!$link)
      {
          die('Could not connect.');
      }
      $query = "insert into employees (name, address, salary) values ('Michael', 'Boston, MA', 3750)";
      cubrid_unbuffered_query($query, $link);
?>
