cubrid_prepare -- Is a sort of API which represents SQL statements

  resource cubrid_prepare(resource conn_identifier, string prepare_stmt [, int option])~

The |cubrid_prepare| function is a sort of API which represents SQL statements
compiled previously to a given connection handle. This pre-compiled SQL
statement will be included in the |cubrid_prepare|.

Accordingly, you can use this statement effectively to execute several times
repeatedly or to process long data. Only a single statement can be used and a
parameter may put a question mark (?) to appropriate area in the SQL
statement. Add a parameter when you bind a value in the VALUES clause of
INSERT statement or in the WHERE clause. Note that it is allowed to bind a
value to a MARK(?) by the |cubrid_bind| only.

{conn_identifier} Connection identifier.

{prepare_stmt} Prepare query.

{option} OID return option CUBRID_INCLUDE_OID.

Request identifier, if process is successful;

FALSE, if process is unsuccessful.

<?php >
  if ($con) {
  $sql = "insert into tbl values ( ?,?,?)"; 
   $req = cubrid_prepare( $con, $sql, CUBRID_INCLUDE_OID ); 
   $i = 0;
   while ( $i < 2 ) { 
   $res = cubrid_bind( $req, 1, "1", "NUMBER"); 
   $res = cubrid_bind( $req, 2, "2"); 
   $res = cubrid_bind( $req, 3, "04:22:34 PM 08/07/2007"); 
   $res = cubrid_execute( $req );  
   $i = $i + 1; 
  }}
